    desc="The relationship between dust-to-gas mass and gas-phase metallicity tells us how efficiently galaxies form and build dust mass as they chemically evolve, revealing the interplay between metal enrichment, dust production, and destruction processes. In this project, I worked on the spatially resolved relationship between dust-to-gas mass ratio and gas-phase metallicity in 11 nearby TYPHOON galaxies."

    title="Park H.-J., et al. 2025) Kinematically colder HI gas as a tracer for star forming gas"
    img="/park2025.png"
    desc="Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium, undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation. Kinematically colder H I components, identified via kinematic decomposition of H I 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H_2). We analyse these colder H I components by decomposing H I 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies."
